Hi ${teamName} Team,

Welcome to the 42nd year of the La Crosse Team Tennis Association (LTTA) league!

We‚Äôre trying a few new things this summer. Visit our website:  
üëâ https://couleeregiontennis.github.io

You'll find:
- Team and full league schedules (printable)
- Team rosters
- League rules
- Info on Green Island Tennis Courts
- GroupMe links to help you find a sub

I plan to add team standings once the season starts. If you run into any issues, let me know. Feedback is welcome.

- Start Times: 5:30 PM or 7:00 PM (check your team schedule)  
- Location: Green Island Park Tennis Courts, La Crosse  
- Fee: $25 ‚Äì Providate payment to ${captain.name} within the first two weeks. If paying by check, make it out to LTTA (confirm with ${captain.name} first).

Court Scheduling Notes

- Match times don‚Äôt always alternate each week (some weeks may repeat the same time).
- Over the season, match times balance out across teams (or close to it).
- Start matches on time, a maximum of 10 minutes warm-up is allowed.
- 5:30 matches should finish by 7:00 PM. If your match is still ongoing, you may choose to move locations to finish your match, or split the points as outlined in our rules.
- Some early 5:30 courts may be unavailable due to Aquinas tennis. We‚Äôll notify you if it affects your team.

---

Sub Policy

- Let your team captain ${captain.name} know if you can‚Äôt make a week.
- Try to use a sub from the GroupMe list before asking players from the other league night.
- Feedback shows subbing is one of the biggest challenges‚ÄîGroupMe should help.

What‚Äôs New This Summer

1. 8-player teams with doubles format (as in the past). Pairs 1 & 2 can opt to play singles (courts 1‚Äì5 only, all must agree).
2. Teams earn a bonus point if they play all matches with rostered players (no subs).
3. We‚Äôre planning a Singles Night. Interested? Sign up here:
