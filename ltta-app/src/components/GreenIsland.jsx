        <h2>Court Numbering</h2>
        <p>
          The courts at Green Island are numbered sequentially from 1 to 13. 
          Court 1 is the court by itself, closest to the ice arena. The courts are then grouped in pairs, with court 13 being on the far left side of the facility in the photo.

        <h3>LTTA Court Assignments</h3>
        <p>
          The teams will be assigned a group of courts for their matches. The groups are as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>Courts 1-5:</li>
            <li>Courts 6-9:</li>
            <li>Courts 10-13:</li>
          </ul>
          The team assigned to the courts 1-5 have the ability to use court 1 and court 2 both, which gives them the option to play
          singles or doubles matches at the 1&2 position. Please consult your team captain for details.
          <br/>
          Teams play on the courts in ascending order. In the case of teams playing at courts 6-9:
