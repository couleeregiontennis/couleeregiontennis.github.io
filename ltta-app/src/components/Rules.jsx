      '5:30 PM matches must vacate courts by 7:00 PM. If unfinished, players may relocate (by mutual agreement) to complete the match using their own balls. Otherwise, use the score at stoppage: 10 points to the side with more total games, 8 points to the opponent, or 8 points each if total games are tied.',

      'Matches consist of two sets using no-ad scoring with standard game points (15-30-40). Play a 7-point tiebreak (win by 2) at 6-6 in any set. Split sets revert to a 7-point tiebreak with servers alternating 1-2-2 points and switching ends every six points.',
      'If the on-court heat index exceeds 95°F, any player may request to begin sets at 2-2 while still playing best two-of-three sets. If the index exceeds 104°F, league play is canceled by 4:30 PM; players may still hit on their own, but results do not count.',
      'League play is not canceled for poor air quality; individuals should decide whether to play, wear a mask, or use a substitute based on personal health concerns.',
      'Each session (5:30 PM versus 7:00 PM matches) is evaluated independently for weather. A rainout in the early session does not automatically cancel the late session if courts dry out.',
      'Team standings are determined weekly using total team points earned divided by the maximum available points, normalizing Format 1 (50 points) and Format 2 (40 points) lineups.',
      'For 2025, Court Group 1 captains may agree to play both #1 and #2 singles. Results integrate into the percentage system and address the high number of substitute-filled singles matches.',
