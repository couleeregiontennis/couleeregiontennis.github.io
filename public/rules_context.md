## League Coordinator & Governance
The La Crosse Team Tennis Association (LTTA) Summer League operates under elected leadership with support from the Coulee Region Tennis Association (CRTA).

* Captains and team representatives elect the League Coordinator at the preseason meeting; Brett Meddaugh agreed to serve in 2025.
* CRTA officers provide organizational oversight for LTTA (see www.couleeregiontennis.com for details).
* Primary site: Green Island Park (2300 7th St S, La Crosse, WI) with 13 outdoor courts. Matches run Tuesdays and Wednesdays, June 3 through August 14, with 5:30 PM and 7:00 PM start times rotating among teams.
* If the coordinator becomes unable to serve, team captains appoint a temporary replacement until the next election.
* A league co-coordinator is elected through the same process to assist and assume duties when necessary.

## Team Captain Responsibilities
* Serve as the primary liaison between the team and the League Coordinator.
* Collect $25 league fees from rostered players and submit them to the coordinator by the second week of play.
* Review score sheet lineups (including substitutes) before matches, communicate adjustments, verify reported scores afterward, total team points, and sign or initial once complete.
* Ensure the team is represented at the preseason meeting, even if a delegate must attend in the captain’s place.
* Help new players understand LTTA rules and format, and designate a co-captain whenever possible.
* Notify the League Coordinator if a team must sit out a summer but intends to return so the roster spot can be reserved; otherwise the team re-enters when an opening is available.

## Team Member Responsibilities
* Attend meetings requested by the captain and arrive at least 10 minutes before match time.
* Secure personal substitutes using the league sub list or a comparable player from the opposite night; ask your captain or the coordinator for help if needed.
* Players may compete one skill level up, and #4 and #5 levels are interchangeable. Playing more than one level up carries no penalty but may prompt a skill re-evaluation after a win.
* Playing down one level or more (unless using the #4/#5 exception) results in four points awarded to that side and 10 points to the opponents.
* When adding a new player or substitute not on the league list, ensure the self-rating/tennis history fits the position and notify the coordinator prior to the match to avoid non-sanctioned player penalties.
* Rostered players may compete on only one night unless a skill-level shortage exists; dual-night players pay the league fee for each night, while shared roster spots (e.g., couples) owe a single $25 fee.
* League communications (rosters, schedules, sub list, rules) are delivered via email. Submit the $25 fee to your captain by week two to cover balls and courts.
* Players may protect their roster spot during a one-year absence by informing the captain and coordinator at the start of the hiatus; replacement players remain temporary and shift to the waiting list when the original player returns.
* Wear tennis-appropriate attire, maintain proper etiquette, and serve as positive role models for spectators.

## Match Play Guidelines
* Matches begin promptly at 5:30 PM and 7:00 PM at Green Island Park unless weather delays occur. Warm-ups (including serves) are limited to 10 minutes and “first ball in” serves are not used.
* Match forfeits take effect at 5:45 PM and 7:15 PM if players are not on the assigned court, aside from weather delays.
* 5:30 PM matches must vacate courts by 7:00 PM. If unfinished, players may relocate (by mutual agreement) to complete the match using their own balls. Otherwise, use the score at stoppage: 10 points to the side with more total games, 8 points to the opponent, or 8 points each if total games are tied.
* Players in the 5:30 PM session leave league-issued balls for the 7:00 PM matches. Winners of the late session may keep the balls or place them in the recycle box.
* Matches consist of two sets using no-ad scoring with standard game points (15-30-40). Play a 7-point tiebreak (win by 2) at 6-6 in any set. Split sets revert to a 7-point tiebreak with servers alternating 1-2-2 points and switching ends every six points.
* If the on-court heat index exceeds 95°F, any player may request to begin sets at 2-2 while still playing best two-of-three sets. If the index exceeds 104°F, league play is canceled by 4:30 PM; players may still hit on their own, but results do not count.
* League play is not canceled for poor air quality; individuals should decide whether to play, wear a mask, or use a substitute based on personal health concerns.
* Each session (5:30 PM versus 7:00 PM matches) is evaluated independently for weather. A rainout in the early session does not automatically cancel the late session if courts dry out.
* Team standings are determined weekly using total team points earned divided by the maximum available points, normalizing Format 1 (50 points) and Format 2 (40 points) lineups.
* For 2025, Court Group 1 captains may agree to play both #1 and #2 singles. Results integrate into the percentage system and address the high number of substitute-filled singles matches.
* Play at your own risk and monitor conditions to avoid falls or injuries.

**Have fun and make new friends.**

## 2025 Team Scoring (per scoresheet)
* 10 points to the winner of a match, including halted matches when one side has more total games.
* 8 points to the non-winner in a split-set match (e.g., 6-2, 3-6, 5-7 tiebreak).
* 8 points to both teams when a halted match ends with equal games won (e.g., 6-4, 4-6).
* 8 points to the trailing side when a halted match has unequal game totals (e.g., 4-6, 4-3); the leading side receives 10 points.
* 6 points to the non-winner of a completed straight-set match (e.g., 2-6, 1-6).
* 6 points awarded to the side that retires in the third set; opponents receive 10 points.
* 4 points awarded to the side that retires in the second set; opponents receive 10 points.
* 4 points to the side using a higher-rated sanctioned player (e.g., a #2 playing a #3 match). Opponents receive 10 points. Sanctioned players are roster members or approved subs prior to play, and #4/#5 players are interchangeable without penalty.
* 2 points to the side that retires in the first set; opponents receive 10 points.
* 1 point to the side using a non-sanctioned player; opponents receive 10 points.
* 0 points to the side that forfeits or arrives too late to compete; opponents receive 10 points.

> USTA Friend at Court rules are the final authority for any unresolved situations.

## League Committee Responsibilities
* Chair at least one preseason meeting to establish season details.
* Collaborate with captains to assemble rosters and approve final rosters, schedules, substitute lists, and rules for league distribution.
* Serve as the primary contact for recruiting new members and forwarding prospects to captains while maintaining the substitute list.
* Ensure nominations or appointments are made for the next season and prepare the season budget.
* Assist picnic host teams when needed, ensure all bills are paid, collect receipts, and oversee collection of team and administrative fees while managing LTTA finances.
* Provide a year-end financial report at the next preseason meeting and prepare the upcoming season budget.
* The League Coordinator receives a $300 annual stipend (unless declined). The League Co-Coordinator supports operations and assumes duties until the next election if the coordinator is incapacitated or dies.

## Team Organization
* Each team roster includes seven players at designated skill levels: one #1, one #2, three #3s, one #4, and one #5.
* Skill ratings range from advanced (#1) to novice (#5) with #2 and #4 in between; these differ from USTA ratings.
* Doubles pairings follow these combinations: #1 with #2, any two team #3s, and #4 with #5.
* Roster and substitute players must be age 18 or older, or a current-year graduating high school senior who turns 18 by September and may therefore compete throughout the summer.

## Skill Descriptions (Self-Rated)
* **#1:** Anticipates well, approaches the net confidently, and can force errors or hit winners. Executes lobs and overheads with above-average success.
* **#2:** Incorporates power and spin, maintains solid footwork, and delivers an above-average first serve. Second serve development is the primary improvement area.
* **#3:** Dependable strokes with a variety of shots (lobs, overheads, approach shots, volleys) and can place serves to create errors.
* **#4:** Stroke variety and depth need improvement. Can direct shots away from opponents but struggles to generate depth on demand. Serve is somewhat consistent and produces limited errors.
* **#5:** Sustains slower-paced rallies with moderate placement. Not yet comfortable with all strokes and lacks serving consistency.
