      <h2>General Info</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          LTTA operates under the oversight of the
          <a href="http://www.couleeregiontennis.com" target="_blank"
            >Coulee Region Tennis Association</a
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Match location: <strong>Green Island Park</strong>, 2300 7th St South,
          La Crosse, WI.
        </li>
        <li>
          Matches are scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday evenings from June 3 –
          August 14 at 5:30pm and 7:00pm.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="captain-responsibilities">
      <h2>Team Captain Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Each team must have a Team Captain. A Co-Captain is strongly
          recommended.
        </li>
        <li>The Captain communicates team needs to the League Coordinator.</li>
        <li>
          Collect league fees from players and submit them by the second week of
          play.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check and adjust line-ups and subs on score sheets before each match.
        </li>
        <li>
          Review and total scores after matches. Sign or initial score sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Represent the team at pre-season meetings or assign a team
          representative.
        </li>
        <li>Help new players understand league rules and match format.</li>
        <li>
          If a team skips a summer but wants to return the following year, the
          spot will be held temporarily if the Captain communicates this in
          advance.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="member-responsibilities">
      <h2>Team Member Responsibilities</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Arrive 10 minutes before your scheduled match time.</li>
        <li>
          Find your own substitute using the sub list or a player from another
          night with similar skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          #3 players may sub for #2; #4 and #5 are interchangeable with no
          penalty.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you play more than one level up, your ranking may be reviewed if
          you win.
        </li>
        <li>
          Playing down a level (outside #4 exception) results in a 10–4 point
          split against your team.
        </li>
        <li>
          Notify the League Coordinator before a match when using a new or
          unsanctioned sub.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may only be on one night’s team unless there's a shortage at your
          level. Double participation requires double fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each player must pay the $25 league fee to the Captain by Week 2
          (covers balls/courts).
        </li>
        <li>
          To keep your spot during a one-year break, inform your Captain and the
          League Coordinator.
        </li>
        <li>
          Wear appropriate attire (shirt and shoes). Behave with good tennis
          etiquette—be a role model for younger spectators.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="match-play-rules">
      <h2>Match Play Rules</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Match times: 5:30pm and 7:00pm. Be ready for warm-up no later than 10
          minutes before match time.
        </li>
        <li>
          Warm-up is limited to 10 minutes total. No "First Ball In" serving.
        </li>
        <li>
          Matches must end on time. 5:30pm matches should finish by 7:00pm.
          Incomplete matches may be finished offsite, same night only, using
          personal balls.
        </li>
        <li>
          If a match is halted, determine winner by total games won. Winner
          receives 10 points, opponent 8. If tied, both get 8 points.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use No-Ad scoring (15, 30, 40, deuce). On deuce, receiver picks the
          side, next point wins the game.
        </li>
        <li>
          Tiebreakers (set or third-set): first to 7 points, win by 2. Use
          standard tiebreak rotation and side changes.
        </li>
        <li>
          If heat index is above 95°F, matches may start at 2-2. If over 104°F,
          play is canceled. Coordinator will decide by 4:30pm. Players can still
          choose to play, but results won’t count.
        </li>
        <li>
          League play continues despite poor air quality. Players can wear masks
          or sub out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each session (5:30 or 7:00) may be canceled independently based on
          weather.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section" id="scoring-system">
      <h2>Scoring System</h2>
      <p>Each match awards up to 10 points. Use the following point system:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          10 points – Match winner by total games (e.g., 6–4, 6–3 or 6–4, 3–4
          with more total games won).
        </li>
        <li>
          8 points – Non-winner in a split set (e.g., 6–2, 3–6, 5–7 tiebreak).
        </li>
        <li>
          8 points – Both teams in a halted match with tied games (e.g., 6–4,
          4–6, can't finish 3rd set).
        </li>
        <li>
          8 points – Non-winner in a halted match but with fewer games (e.g.,
          4–6, 4–3).
        </li>
        <li>6 points – Non-winner of a completed match (e.g., 2–6, 1–6).</li>
        <li>6 points – Third set retiree; opponent gets 10 points.</li>
        <li>4 points – Second set retiree; opponent gets 10 points.</li>
        <li>
          4 points – Team using a higher-rated sanctioned player (e.g., #2
          playing a #3 match); opponent gets 10 points.
        </li>
        <li>2 points – First set retiree; opponent gets 10 points.</li>
        <li>
          1 point – Team used a non-sanctioned player; opponent gets 10 points.
        </li>
        <li>0 points – Forfeit or late arrival; opponent gets 10 points.</li>
